# Skills

← Back to the [README](../README.md)

Skills are domain-specific review modules that sharpen the agent's focus on a particular class of bug or pattern. Each skill injects a focused instruction block and optional reference files into the system prompt.

## Built-in skills

| Name             | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `code-review`    | Adversarial correctness review: finds real, demonstrable bugs only. Reports nothing without a concrete proof path (specific input → failure → observable symptom). Includes per-language reference files for JavaScript/TypeScript and PHP/Laravel.                                       |
| `test-integrity` | Catches silent test tampering: test edits that hide a behavior change rather than track a genuine spec change. Flags weakened/deleted/disabled/rewritten assertions, snapshots, and lowered coverage thresholds (Vitest/Jest, PHPUnit), reporting only when a regression could be masked. |

Enable a built-in skill with `--skill`:

```bash
code-review --skill code-review
```

Or set it permanently via the environment variable:

```yml
variables:
  CODE_REVIEW_SKILLS: code-review
```

Multiple skills can be specified by repeating `--skill` or comma-separating values in `CODE_REVIEW_SKILLS`:

```bash
code-review --skill code-review --skill my-custom-skill
```

## External skills

A `--skill` value can carry a protocol prefix to load a skill from outside the package. The resolved directory must contain a `SKILL.md` in the same [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) format as project skills.

| Spec                                           | Resolves to                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `code-review`, `test-integrity`                | Built-in skills bundled with the package                                         |
| `npm:@scope/pkg`                               | `node_modules/@scope/pkg` (walked up from the working dir; monorepo-hoist aware) |
| `npm:@scope/bundle/security`                   | A `security/` sub-directory inside an installed npm bundle                       |
| `file:./path/to/skill`                         | A local path (relative paths resolve from the working dir)                       |
| `git:https://host/group/project.git`           | A shallow clone of the repo's default branch                                     |
| `git:https://host/group/bundle.git#v1.2.0/sec` | A clone pinned to ref `v1.2.0`, loading the `sec/` sub-directory                 |
| `git+ssh://git@host/group/project.git`         | A clone over SSH (recommended for private GitLab repos)                          |
| `<marketplace>:<plugin>/<skill>`               | A skill inside a registered [marketplace](#marketplaces) (resolved by manifest)  |

### `git:` / `git+ssh:` skills

The repo is shallow-cloned at a **pinned ref** (a tag, branch, or commit). Append the ref — and an optional in-repo sub-directory — as a `#<ref>[/<subpath>]` fragment:

```bash
# repo root, default branch
code-review --skill git:https://gitlab.example.com/tools/review-skill.git

# pin a tag, load a sub-directory from a multi-skill bundle
code-review --skill 'git:https://gitlab.example.com/tools/skills.git#v1.2.0/security'

# private GitLab repo over SSH (preferred), pinned to a branch
code-review --skill 'git+ssh://git@gitlab.example.com/tools/skills.git#main'
```

Following the project's SSH-over-HTTPS convention, prefer `git+ssh://git@<host>/<group>/<project>.git` for private GitLab remotes — authentication then uses the SSH key already available to the runner. The scp-style shorthand (`git@host:group/project.git`) is intentionally not accepted, since its `:` collides with the `#ref` fragment; use the full `git+ssh://` URI instead.

Clones are cached on disk under `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/code-review/skills/`, keyed by URL and ref. A tag or commit ref is immutable, so the cache is reused indefinitely; a **branch** ref is also cached, so set `CODE_REVIEW_REFRESH_SKILLS=1` to re-clone when the branch has moved (or delete the cache directory).

## Marketplaces

A [Claude plugin marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces) is a git repository with a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` catalog that groups skills into named **plugins**. Instead of hand-writing the full clone URL and the physical `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill>` path for every `git:` skill, you declare the marketplace **once** and then reference skills by their logical `<marketplace>:<plugin>/<skill>` name — the path is resolved from the manifest.

Skills are the open [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) `SKILL.md` standard and are portable across tools; only the marketplace _packaging_ is vendor-specific. This tool reads the Anthropic (Claude Code) `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` layout by default.

### Declaring marketplaces

Register marketplaces with the repeatable `--marketplace` flag or the comma-separated `CODE_REVIEW_MARKETPLACES` variable. Each declaration is `<name>=<[format:]url[#ref]>`:

```yml
variables:
  # Declare the marketplace once…
  CODE_REVIEW_MARKETPLACES: 'acme=https://ci-bot:${MARKETPLACE_GIT_TOKEN}@git.example.com/org/skills-marketplace.git#1.0.0'
  # …then pick skills by <marketplace>:<plugin>/<skill>
  CODE_REVIEW_SKILLS: 'code-review,acme:dev/aria-apg,acme:dev/git-flow'
```

| Part        | Notes                                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<name>`    | Short handle used in skill specs. Cannot be `npm`, `file`, `git`, or `builtin` (they collide with skill-spec protocols).         |
| `[format:]` | Optional manifest format. Defaults to `anthropic` (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`). Only `anthropic` is supported today.      |
| `<url>`     | A git URL. Use `git+ssh://git@host/group/repo.git` for private GitLab over SSH. scp-style shorthand is not accepted.             |
| `#<ref>`    | Optional pinned tag/branch/commit; the whole fragment is the ref (branch names may contain `/`). Defaults to the default branch. |

A skill reference always requires an explicit skill: `acme:dev` (plugin only) is rejected — use `acme:dev/aria-apg`.

The marketplace repo is cloned once and shared across every skill selected from it, using the same on-disk cache and `CODE_REVIEW_REFRESH_SKILLS=1` refresh behavior as `git:` skills. Embedded URL credentials are redacted from all logs, hints, and errors. Plugins whose `source` points at a remote (`github`/`url`/`git-subdir`/`npm`) are not fetched — only plugins that live inside the marketplace repository are resolved.

## Project skills (auto-discovery)

Drop a skill directory anywhere between the git root and `cwd`. The reviewer walks up the tree and loads every skill it finds:

```
.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md      # preferred location
.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md      # alternative location
```

`SKILL.md` follows the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) format — a YAML frontmatter block followed by the skill body:

```md
---
name: my-skill
description: One-line description shown in the summary footer.
---

Your skill instructions here. The reviewer reads these as part of its system prompt.
```

A `references/` subdirectory alongside `SKILL.md` is optional. Any files placed there are made available to the reviewer by path — the agent can read them on demand using its file-reading tool.

Project skills take precedence over built-in skills with the same name. A skill closer to `cwd` overrides one closer to the git root.

## Skills footer

When skills are active, their names appear in the review summary footer (the MR note on GitLab, the PR summary comment on GitHub), each linked to the `SKILL.md` the run loaded:

```md
Skills: [`code-review`](https://github.com/weareikko/code-review/blob/0.9.5/skills/code-review/SKILL.md), [`ikko-tools:dev/aria-apg`](https://gitlab.example.com/tools/ikko-tools/-/blob/main/plugins/dev/skills/aria-apg/SKILL.md)
```

Marketplace skills are shown under their full `<marketplace>:<plugin>/<skill>` name, because a bare skill name says nothing about which marketplace and plugin it came from. See [Skills footer links](./output-format.md#summary-note) for the link target of each skill source, and which skills stay unlinked.
